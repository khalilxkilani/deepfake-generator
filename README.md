# Deepfake Generator
Implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), and trained it to generate realistic looking synthesized images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio.

This project was created in the course Understanding Deepfakes with Keras on Coursera.
